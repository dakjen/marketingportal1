feat: Implement refined user role and permission system

This commit introduces a more granular user role and permission system based on the following four roles: admin, admin2, internal, and external.

Key changes include:
- **Admin (full access):** Unchanged.
- **Admin2 (view-only everything):**
    - Can view all content and forms across the application.
    - All interactive elements (inputs, buttons for adding/editing/deleting) are disabled in SocialMediaEntries, PhysicalMarketingEntries, ProjectManagementPage, and ProfilePage (Manage Users section).
- **Internal (admin-like, but restricted):**
    - Can create and modify entries in SocialMediaEntries and PhysicalMarketingEntries.
    - Cannot access the Project Management tab.
    - Cannot manage or edit users in the ProfilePage.
- **External (dashboard-only for allowed projects):**
    - Can only view the dashboard for projects they are explicitly allowed to see.
    - Cannot create/modify entries, manage projects, or manage users.

Specific file changes:
- `src/SocialMediaEntries.js`: Updated visibility and disabled states for admin2, enabled create/modify for internal users.
- `src/PhysicalMarketingEntries.js`: Updated visibility and disabled states for admin2, enabled create/modify for internal users.
- `src/ProjectManagementPage.js`: Restricted access to admin and admin2, with all interactive elements disabled for admin2.
- `src/ProfilePage.js`: Restricted "Manage Users" section visibility to admin and admin2, with all interactive elements disabled for admin2. Re-added admin2 option to role selection dropdowns (disabled for admin2 users).
- `src/Dashboard.js`: Implemented filtering of projects for external users based on allowedProjects.
